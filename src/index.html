                <div class="column">
                    <p>In 1950, Vassily, the Grandfather of Effy Ligris and her father Stavros Ligris planted 
                            a grove of vatsikes olive trees on family land in the hills near 
                            Kalethéa, in the Kalamata region of Greece.</p>
                        <p>For more than half a century since then,  the olive oil produced from this grove has been 
                            a central ingredient of family life: the harvest, the way they eat, their belief in its 
                            health benefits and even in family rituals and ceremonies. 
                            Each new-born Ligris is anointed with the oil at baptism and thus is introduced to 
                            the family olive oil t a very young age.</p>
                        <p>The special respect for the grove and its fruit has been handed down from generation to generation. 
                            Effy, with the approval and blessing of her family, has established her company Kalikori so 
                            that she is able to share this bounty with others across the Atlantic. 
                            It is fitting that the name Kalikori means“good daughter” in Greek and pays homage 
                            to Effy’s forebears and her heritage, She aspires to live up to her name by continuing 
                            the traditions of her family.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, She has named Kalikori’s premium cold-pressed L’Olivier de Vassily olive oil, 
                            in honor of her Grandfather “Papou Vassily”.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the year, family members nurture the olive grove. Théo Kosta, Effy’s uncle and master caretaker, 
                            begins the harvest in November before all the olives are ripe. The olives are gathered by hand, 
                            just as it has been done for hundreds of years. Then they are sent to the pressing machine 
                            which washes and sorts them before extracting the oil. </p>
                        <p>The small green vatsikes variety of olives are exclusively grown for oil. 
                            And as a result of an early harvest and the rocky mountainous kalamata region, 
                            the amount of oil produced from the Ligris grove is small but of Premium quality, 
                            L”Olivier de Vassily is not a blend it comes only from the olives of the Vatsikes 
                            trees planted by Effy’s “Papou” and Father, The early picking gives the oil 
                            its green colour, its aroma its peppery finish and the flavor of spring grass 
                            under the Mediterranean sun. Like fine wine, the unique flavor of each year’s 
                            yield depends on the climate and the rainfall. As the quantity is limited, the 
                            number of bottles varies from year to year.  </p>
                        <p>L’Olivier de Vassily olive oil is best consumed raw as a finishing oil drizzled on 
                            cooked dishes such as fish or soup, in pesto and on salads, 
                            or simply as a delicious oil for dipping bread into.</p>
                        <p>From the Ligris Family estate to you comes a taste of Greece, 
                            a taste of tradition a taste of Spring.  </p>
